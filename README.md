# HotelBookingApp
App to allow the booking of a single Hotel room made for a job application challenge.

The application was made using Java 17 and Spring Boot 2.7.3, using the Facade Design Pattern.

The database for the system was made using H2, for the fast response time and to avoid the need of other programs outside of Java for the API to work.

To facilitate the tests, use the postman collection attached to the API.
